* Object detection is a computer technology related to computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in digital images and videos. Well-researched domains of object detection include face detection and pedestrian detection. Object detection has applications in many areas of computer vision, including image retrieval and video surveillance. 

* There are various types of object detection algorithms, including :

     * Region-Based Conolutional Nerual Network (R-CNN)
     
     * Fast R-CNN
     
     * Faster R-CNN
     
     *  Single Shot Multibox Detecton (SSD)
     
     * Mask R-CNN
     
     * YOLO
     
* We will consider the YOLO algorithm in this jupyter-notebook.

* Let’s review the YOLO (You Only Look Once) real-time object detection algorithm, which is one of the most effective object detection algorithms that also encompasses many of the most innovative ideas coming out of the computer vision research community. Object detection is a critical capability of autonomous vehicle technology. It’s an area of computer vision that’s exploding and working so much better than just a few years ago.

* Let's start then :), open the file named Autonomous_driving_application_Car_detection_v3a.ipynb with Jupyter-notebook. Have fun :).
